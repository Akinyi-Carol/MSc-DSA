Please see my feedback below:
1. The research questions could be more specific and testable; meaning that it should be possible to design an empirical study to collect data and answer the question. E.g.""What is the impact of imported vehicles on fuel efficiency and emissions in Kenya, and how does it compare to locally manufactured vehicles?"" and """"What are the most frequently purchased vehicle models and brands in Kenya and what factors influence consumers' purchasing decisions?"" Having a good research question is crucial for the success of any research project, as it provides a roadmap for the study and helps to ensure that the findings are meaningful and useful.
2. Some of the takeaways from the visualizations were not clear.  A good practice when presenting is to include a caption above or below the visualization with a 1 sentence takeaway.
3. Some of your charts are too colorful, which can distract the audience. Sometimes we use color as ""eye candy"", but we should focus on using it to draw attention to some aspect of the visualization. Otherwise our brain tries to draw meaning from all the colors and where there isn't, it can confuse the audience, even it may look ""nice"", the cost in the form of confusion to the brain is not worth it.
4. In the PCA discussion, I would discuss how each of the variables loaded to the PCs and what % of the variance each PC explained. 
5. Your plot of the Kmeans groups by PC1/PC2 does clearly show there are 4 clusters.
6. In compiling your recommendations, I recommend you more clearly reference your analysis to support your recommendations.

Below are a few tips on creating effective data visualizations:
a.  Choose the right type of visualization: There are many types of data visualizations, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. It's important to choose the right type of visualization for the data you want to present and the message you want to convey.
b. Keep it simple: Avoid cluttering the visualization with too much information. Stick to the most important data and use colors, labels, and annotations sparingly.
c. Use clear labeling and annotations: Make sure the axes, labels, and annotations are clear and easy to read. Use a font that is large enough to be easily legible.
d. Highlight patterns and trends: Use visual elements like colors, shapes, and lines to highlight patterns and trends in the data. This can help to make the data more interpretable and easy to understand.
f. Test and iterate: Always test your visualization with a sample of the target audience to ensure that it effectively communicates the intended message. If necessary, iterate and make improvements based on feedback.",1

When developing research questions, they should be formulated on basis of the problem statement. Questions are majorly formulated on a concept of dependent vs independent variable. 

Secondly, it's a good academic practice to cite, reference and cross reference any knowledge you use in your research. This goes a long way in allowing others to fact check any points of concern and where possible add or subtract from the findings. 

Finally, charts are a great way to share statistical evidence and also to explain abstract constructs of any research question. However, with limited or no labeling at all, it becomes another recipe for confusion of concepts. In future, endeavor to label graphs with proper keys, headings, metrics and most importantly, again, if borrowed, with proper citations. ",1

Your presenter was very clear and informative, and I want the audience to be able to focus on the presenter's words.

Each team member had a chance to present which is critical.  

The riders are now a critical part of our economy and service delivery.  Very practical recommendations have been made.  I  suggest the following points be included for the future.  

- The question of safety was not raised. The risks that the industry faces are major for the safety of drivers and other road users.  Record of safety can be included when thinking of high performance.

- The insights about the ratings decreasing as the days of the week progress is very valuable.  How would the companies like Sendy innovate around this?  This insight can be further examined and provide ideas like, at the weekend which is peak, should there be route optimization for the riders?  Should some riders be assigned to particular routes, is the feedback worse in particular geographical areas etc?

- In addition to rewards, the training of the riders/sensitization to customer feedback should be considered.

The rise in Non Communicable Diseases is definitely alarming.  

The presentation made clear the serious issue that we are dealing with.  However, it should have been structured much more clearly.  The slide on Scope was difficult to follow as it had alot of information.  

In terms of context, diabetes cases are doubling in Kenya annually. This is alarming for any health economist.  This would have been a point to truly emphasis.

The model does predict the probability of diabetes. The recommendations, conclusions should have been more robust.  

- Preventative measures, should these be emphasized as part of health policy?
- Are some ages more at risk ?
